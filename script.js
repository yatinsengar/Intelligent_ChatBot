Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can represent and store multiple states simultaneously through superposition and entanglement. This enables quantum computers to perform complex calculations at unprecedented speeds, potentially revolutionizing fields like cryptography, optimization, and material science.";
